<h3>Auto-response configurable text via FFN tab in settings</h3>

Includes:

* Trigger text
* Response to the triggered text

<ins>How it works:</ins>

Someone sends a message, for example: "oka: hi". And your client responds with "<sender's name>: hi" (<sender's name> can be disabled).

1. Enter text you want your client to respond to in global chat
2. Enter response text that your client will respond with

Example:

![auto response](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a87590dd-b343-40fd-9cb0-7c844ac85589)

<h3>Planned features for THIS version of FFN</h3>
